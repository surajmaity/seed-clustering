# Seed Kernel Clustering

This project performs clustering analysis on seed kernels using various attributes such as area, perimeter, compactness, length, width, asymmetry, and groove. The objective is to explore the relationships and patterns between different types of seeds based on these features.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **"Seeds" dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/236/seeds). This dataset contains seed kernel measurements from different varieties of wheat. The dataset includes the following columns:
- `area`
- `perimeter`
- `compactness`
- `length`
- `width`
- `asymmetry`
- `groove`
- `class`: The type of seed kernel.

## Project Structure
The project consists of a Jupyter notebook (`seed kernel clustering.ipynb`), which contains the entire analysis workflow. The major sections of the notebook include:
1. Data loading and preprocessing.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) through visualization.
3. Clustering algorithms application (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering).
4. Evaluation of clustering performance.

## Clustering Methodology
The notebook applies various clustering techniques, including:
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering

Each method is evaluated based on how well it groups seed kernels into distinct clusters based on their attributes.

## Results
The clustering analysis reveals patterns in the dataset, grouping seed kernels into meaningful clusters based on their physical attributes. The visualizations include scatter plots and dendrograms, illustrating the clusters and relationships between the different seed types.
